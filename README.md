## Overview

## My process

Since I only used HTML5 and CSS3, I started by laying out all the content
in my index.HTML

Once I had all my assets laid out I created containers to be able to target these
elements later with css, and linked my files together.

within my css file I assigned the background colors, font-family, h1, p, and font-Weight
properties.

the first outermost div element was the container for the QR image and text content
this div was resized to match the size of the given design. I also gave it the necessary
margins to center this div.

within this div container using css I added the necessary padding and width adjustments
to shape the contents into more of a card shape. I gave it border radius to add the
rounded look.

lastly, I added a box shadow to give the card more depths.



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Node.js [express.js, nodemon]


### What I learned

I wasn't too familiar with box-shadow, but I learned to use it to a mild degree.

### Continued development

Although I didn't use any frameworks, I am familiar with bootstrap and other libraries.
I wanted to be able to implement bootstrap and other libraries to make the creation of simple
components much easier. I also hope to cut the development time shorter.
